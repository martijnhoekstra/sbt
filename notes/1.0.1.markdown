This is a hotfix release for sbt 1.0.x series.

### Improvements

- Various improves around watch source feature. See below.

### Bug fixes

- Fixes command support for cross building `+` command. The `+` added to sbt 1.0 traverses over the subprojects, respecting `crossScalaVersions`; however, it no longer accepted commands as arguments. This brings back the support for it. [#3446][3446] by [@jroper][@jroper]
- Fixes `addSbtPlugin` to use the correct version of sbt during cross building. [#3442][3442] by [@dwijnand][@dwijnand]
- Fixes `run in Compile` task not including `Runtime` configuration, by reimplementing `run` in terms of `bgRun`. [#3477][3477] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- Shows `actual` as a potential option of `inspect` [#3335][3335] by [@Duhemm][@Duhemm]
- Includes base directory to watched sources. [#3439][3439] by [@Duhemm][@Duhemm]
- Adds an attempt to workaround intermittent `NullPointerException` around logging. [util#121][util121] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- Reverts a bad forward porting. [#3481][3481] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### WatchSource

The watch source feature went through a major change from sbt 0.13 to sbt 1.0 using NIO; however, it did not have clear migration path, so we are rectifying that in sbt 1.0.1.

First, `sbt.WatchSource` is a new alias for `sbt.internal.io.Source`. Hopefully this is easy enough to remember because the key is named `watchSources`. Next, `def apply(base: File)` and `def apply(base: File, includeFilter: FileFilter, excludeFilter: FileFilter)` constructors were added to the companion object of `sbt.WatchSource`.

For backward compatibility, sbt 1.0.1 adds `+=` support (`Append` instance) from `File` to `Seq[WatchSource]`.

So, if you have a directory you want to watch:

    watchSources += WatchSource(sourceDirectory.value)

If you have a list of files:

    watchSources ++= (sourceDirectory.value ** "*.scala").get
